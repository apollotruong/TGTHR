# TGTHR
TGTHR brings people together in thousands of cities to do more of what they want to do in life. It is organized around one simple idea: when we get together and do the things that matter to us, we’re at our best. And that’s what TGTHR does. It helps people meet up, explore, teach and learn the things that help them come alive.
